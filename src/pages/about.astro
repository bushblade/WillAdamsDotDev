  <h1>A little <span class='text-primary'>more</span> about me!</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there, I'm <strong>Will Adams</strong> - I'm 46 years of age with a diverse
    range of interests and experiences that have led me to develop a broad skill
    set, including web development, knife making, Bushcraft and climbing.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey into web development began around 2008 when I started my <a
      href='https://bushblade.co.uk'
      target='_blank'
      class='link link-accent'>knife making</a
    >
    business and needed a website to showcase my work. I attended a adult learning
    course teaching the basics using Dreamweaver, but quickly worked out you can
    do much more writing the code yourself!
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I've taken more than a few Udemy courses, online tutorials,
    taught myself to touch type and geeked up on whole lot of documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently I help out students of <a
      href='https://www.traversymedia.com/'
      target='_blank'
      class='link link-accent'>Brad Traversy</a
    > in his web development courses to learn and improve their skills. When I'm
    not helping others or making knives, you can find me at my local
    <a
      href='https://www.freeklime.co.uk/'
      target='_blank'
      class='link link-accent'>climbing gym</a
    >, or out roaming the Peak District hills. I'm also one of the founding
    members of the
    <a

      target='_blank'
      class='link link-accent'
    >
      West Yorkshire Bushcraft</a
    > group, where I share my skills and knowledge with other outdoor enthusiasts.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm always eager to learn and explore new things, both in my personal and
    professional life, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.
