  <h1>A little <span class='text-primary'>more</span> about me!</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there, I'm <strong>Will Adams</strong> - I'm 46 years of age with a
    diverse range of interests and experiences that have led me to develop a
    broad skill set, including web development, knife making, Bushcraft and
    climbing.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey into web development began around 2008 when I started my <a
      href='https://bushblade.co.uk'
      target='_blank'>knife making</a
    >
     business and needed a website to showcase my work. I attended an adult
    learning course teaching the basics using Dreamweaver, but quickly worked
    out you can do much more writing the code yourself!
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I've taken more than a few Udemy courses, online tutorials,
    taught myself to touch type and geeked up on whole lot of documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently I help out students of <a
      href='https://www.traversymedia.com/'
      target='_blank'>Brad Traversy</a
    > in his web development courses to learn and improve their skills. When I'm
    not helping others or making knives, you can find me at my local
    <a href='https://www.freeklime.co.uk/' target='_blank'>climbing gym</a>, or
    out roaming the Peak District hills. I'm also one of the founding members of
    the
    <a href='https://www.westyorkshirebushcraft.co.uk/' target='_blank'>
      West Yorkshire Bushcraft</a
    > group, where I share my skills and knowledge with other outdoor
    enthusiasts.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm always eager to learn and explore new things, both in my personal and
    professional life, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.
